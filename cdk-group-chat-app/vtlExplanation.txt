get_groups_created_by_user_request.vtl

The first line gets the limit from the request and sets it to a variable called $limit. If no limit was sent, a default of 10 is applied. If a limit of more than 10(> 10) was sent, we default to 10(#set($limit=10)), before proceeding.
This limit represents the amount of data objects we want back with every request.
We also get the nextToken from the request and if none was sent, this implies it's the first request. So we default the nextToken variable to null since it's a string.
For the nextToken variable, $util.toJson($util.defaultIfNull($ctx.args.nextToken, null)).
Getting the groups created by a user involves using our first Global Secondary index(GSI1), which was  indexName: "groupsCreatedByUser".
We would use begins_with (a, substr) function in our query operation to carry out this request. We want all groups for a particular user that begins with GROUP#.
"expression": "#GSI1PK = :GSI1PK and begins_with(#GSI1SK,:GSI1SK)",
